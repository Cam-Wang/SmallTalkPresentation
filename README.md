# Smalltalk
## History
- Smalltalk was developed at Xerox Palo Alto Research center in 1980, and is actually Smalltalk-80, although there are many variants of the language
- Earlier versions were passed around for peer review to Hewlett Packard, Apple, UC Berkeley among others
- Squeak is an implementation of Smalltalk-80 that’s open source, VisualWorks is another
- Two CA based organizations, ParcPlace Systems and Digitalk sold Smalltalk environments and support during the end of the 1980s to the middle of the 1990s
- ParcPlace gave support for Unix systems and Digitalk focused on Microsoft Windows computers
- Originally, Smalltalk was expensive, needed a lot of memory, and was only available to sizeable organizations, although Sigitalk tried to reduce the pride to sell more
- In 1995, the two competing companies became ParcPlace-Digitalk and later in 1997 became ObjectShare it didn’t last past the millenium 
Squeak has the most active community around it, since it is open source
