# Smalltalk
## History
- Smalltalk was developed at Xerox Palo Alto Research center in 1980, and is actually Smalltalk-80, although there are many variants of the language
- Earlier versions were passed around for peer review to Hewlett Packard, Apple, UC Berkeley among others
- Squeak is an implementation of Smalltalk-80 that’s open source, VisualWorks is another
- Two CA based organizations, ParcPlace Systems and Digitalk sold Smalltalk environments and support during the end of the 1980s to the middle of the 1990s
- ParcPlace gave support for Unix systems and Digitalk focused on Microsoft Windows computers
- Originally, Smalltalk was expensive, needed a lot of memory, and was only available to sizeable organizations, although Sigitalk tried to reduce the pride to sell more
- In 1995, the two competing companies became ParcPlace-Digitalk and later in 1997 became ObjectShare it didn’t last past the millenium 
Squeak has the most active community around it, since it is open source
## Tasks Small Talk is suitable for
- Smalltalk was designed to be easy to use by not only computer scientists, but also by people without an extensive technology background
- Messaging is the central idea of Smalltalk-good for programs that require a lot of communication between objects
- Primitive types are also used as objects, a class derived from a primitive type can extend it's functionality
## Why consider Small Talk?
- The language can do the same amount of work as other languages, while using about a third of the code
- With less code to write, test, and maintain, there is a lower cost to develop, along with the fact that is closer to spoken sentences than dense than other low level languages, means more, less trained people can understand it
## Syntax of Small Talk
- Characters are reprsented with a '$' before them such as `$A`
- String are represented with single quotes such as `'foo bar'`
